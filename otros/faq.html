    <p>The product key is located inside the product packaging, on the receipt or confirmation page for a digital purchase or in a confirmation e-mail that shows you purchased Windows.

Before using operating system copies from this site for install, re-install or recovery on devices with pre-installed operating systems, see your device manufacturer or reseller for the customized drivers and applications specific to your machine. Using operating systems copied from this site for install, re-install or recovery may void your support agreement with your manufacturer or reseller. Any drivers or programs that were installed by the device manufacturer or reseller may be removed during installation.

<button onclick="myFunction('Demo2')" class="w3-button w3-block w3-black w3-left-align">My Windows 7 product key won't verify. What's the problem?</button>
<div id="Demo2" class="w3-hide w3-container">
    <p>The most common issue is the use of a product key for a product not currently supported by the site such as an Upgrade key, an MSDN key, product keys for pre-installed media or an Enterprise edition key. For access to MSDN products or Enterprise edition visit the MSDN Portal or the Volume Licensing Service Center. Upgrades and pre-installed media are not currently supported by the tools on the site.

If you believe you have a valid product key and are still receiving an error, please contact Support.</p>

<button onclick="myFunction('Demo3')" class="w3-button w3-block w3-black w3-left-align">I bought Windows 7 through a website. After talking to the merchant, I was told I had a "system builder" product key. Why doesn't that work?</button>
<div id="Demo3" class="w3-hide w3-container">
    <p>Not all “system builder” products for Windows 7 are currently available on the site. We are working to add more, but for now, we suggest you contact Support.</p>

<button onclick="myFunction('Demo4')" class="w3-button w3-block w3-black w3-left-align">I purchased my copy of Windows through a university. Can I download it here?</button>

    <p>Yes, but you’ll need your product key. Go to the Academic Products download page and select the version of Windows to begin.</p>
